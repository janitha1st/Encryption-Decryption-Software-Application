# Encryption-Decryption-Software-Application
You can simply Encrypt your TEXT(.txt) files from this Programme.
You have to simply download the Project from this Repository and open it from NetBeans IDE 8.1
Then go to "Libraries" and right click on it
then select "Add JAR/Folder"
after that select "org.apache.commons.io.jar" (which include in this repository.. you have to download and extract before)
Finally run the "DecryptT.java" file...

For clear description go to my blog "http://hellocyberjb.blogspot.com/2017/04/encryption-decryption.html"
Thank You
